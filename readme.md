## About Rewem
This webapp allows government bodies to control how wepaons are used and to mitigate against weapon theft. Gun use permissions such as location, authorized RF IDs, number of times gun can be used and how long each gun use duration should last are controlled from this server. A device on the gun then reads from this server and determines whether a gun is ready for use or not. The goal is to help increase gun use accountability and mitigate against gun misuse and unauthorized use.
